                    <p><b>1. Introduction:</b>
Uganda Athletics Federation is the national governing body of the sports of athletics under the rules and regulations of International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). It is a voluntary, non profiting making body with the mandate of developing and promoting athletics in Uganda in line with the IAAF statutes.
<br/> <br/>

<b>2. Foundation:</b>
The idea of starting an annual athletics championship in Uganda was first discussed in an informal meeting at the home of Major Lawrence at Nakasero. On 4 April 1925, a group of enthusiastic sports personalities convened a meeting at the then Imperial Hotel in Kampala to endorse the possibility of organsing an annual athletics championships. This inaugural meeting later gave birth to the Uganda Native (African) Athletic Association aimed at developing and promoting local athletics (for Ugandans). The founder members of the association included former Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly Hon. S. W. Kulubya who was also the 1st African Mayor of Kampala City and Chairman of National Council of Sports. The Executive of the Ugandan Native Athletic Association included Honorary Secretary Sir. Sydaly Abrahams. The UNAA which started in colonial period (1925) later evolved into Uganda Amateur Athletic Association (UAAA) at Independence (1962) and transformed into Uganda Amateur Athletics Federation in 1993 then Uganda Athletics Federation in 2004 when internally, athletics embraced the component of professionalism. In 1954, Uganda Native Athletics Association affiliated to the then International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF). These names later changed into and are known as Uganda Athletics Federation (UAF) and International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). By affiliating to IAAF, it is automatically affiliated to Africa Athletics Confederation (CAA) and Eastern Africa Athletics Region (EAAR). Locally, the athletics is an affiliate of the Uganda Olympic Committee and registered with National Council of Sports (NCS). The membership of Athletics moved from individuals as at the initiation in 1925 to clubs and district associations when it became a federation in 1993.<br/> <br/>

<b>3. Organisation of events:</b>

The first inaugural athletics competition was organised on 3 August 1925, four months after the meeting at Imperial Hotel and was attended by nine clubs. That same year, the Uganda Native Athletics Association was registered formally. Since its formation athletics was mainly track and field affair with more emphasis on sprints and jumps. Road races, cross country and mountain running were introduced later into the programme of athletics. The 1st cross country on recommended surface was organised in 1996 and the 2nd st national Mountain running was organised in 2008. In 1995, under the leadership of Elijah Mushemeza, focus was shifted to middle and long distance with the 1st event organised in Kapchorwa. This event opened gates of the current stream of middle and long distance. Athletics in Uganda is now as defined by the IAAF track and field (sprints, running, jumps and throws), road, cross country and mountain running. These events are organised at club, association, regional/zones and national levels. Athletics is practiced at school, community/club levels in every district. Athletics teams are national in nature; athletes coming from every region of the country.<br/><br/>
